To display an entire DDG, run FileChooserDemo, select "Display a DDG...", navigate to the location of an RDF database containing a DDG, select its directory, and click "Display DDG".

To skip the GUI and simply display a DDG, hardwire the location of the DDG into the DisplayRdfDb class and run it.
