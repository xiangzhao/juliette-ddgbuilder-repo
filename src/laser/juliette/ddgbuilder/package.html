The laser.ddg.ljil package contains classes that allow for 
building a DDG for processes written in Little-JIL.  The classes in this
package are implementations for the interface in laser.ddg.
</p>

<p>
Little-JIL steps correspond to procedures in DDG terminology.  A non-leaf step is represented
with a StartStepInstanceNode, 0 or more IntermStepInstanceNodes and a FinishStepInstanceNode.
Leaf steps are represented with a single StepInstanceNode. 
</p>

<p>
If a step has a prerequisite and/or a postrequisite, the DDG should contain Virtual nodes
(start, intermediate and finish) that corresponds to an imaginary sequential step whose
children are the prerequisite, step to which requisites are attached and the postrequisite,
in that order.  This is necessary to capture the correct data and control flow 
between a node and its requisites.
